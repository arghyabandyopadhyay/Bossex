# Bossex
It is an initiative by me to have an open source accounting software.

The application is in development phase. Contributions to the source codes are very much appreciated. We want to develop this application with the open source community, and for a non monatary cause.
You can run and edit the code or contribute to them using Gitpod.io, a free online development environment, with a single click.

### All the widgets, modules and models are implemented in Javafx 14 and we do wish to work with more updated versions of java now.
